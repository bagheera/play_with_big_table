Looks like ListProperty cannot have custom types

try this:
Consider this:

Employee has zero/more children
I want to model so that the following queries are optimised:
Find all employees having 2 teenage daughters.

As I understand, there are broadly two ways of modeling this One way is to make each child refer to its parent-employee.

class Employee(db.Model):
  num_daughters = db.IntegerProperty()
  num_sons = db.IntegerProperty()

class Child(db.Model):
  name = db.StringProperty()
  gender = db.StringProperty()
  age = db.IntegerProperty()
  parent = db.ReferenceProperty(Employee, collection_name="children")

and then do:
   select * from employee where num_daughters = 2
followed by 
   select * from child where age > 12 and age < 20 and parent IN :1 #(bind to a list of max 30 employees)

The second way is to simulate a List of children by defining
